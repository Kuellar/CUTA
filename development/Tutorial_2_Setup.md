## Setup git

Before starting to program, it is necessary to create a branch to isolate all the changes made in the program. Once these changes have been verified, we proceed to merge them.

1. Create a new branch called ＜branch＞

2. Update repo in your visual studio

```
git pull
```

3. Change branch from main to ＜branch＞
```
git checkout ＜branch＞
```

result:

Now you can make changes in the code without making a mess :)
